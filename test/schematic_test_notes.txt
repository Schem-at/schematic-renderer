// We can't easily run WASM in this environment without proper setup (it needs to load .wasm file).
// But we can check if there are other methods exposed or check existing tests.

// Instead of running a script (which might fail due to WASM loading in this shell),
// I will assume the cache hypothesis is partially correct AND the schematic needs explicit bounds.

// But wait, `SchematicObject` caches dimensions in `_cachedDimensions`.
// If I clear that cache, maybe `getDimensions()` returns the correct value?
// But `buildSchematicMeshes` doesn't use `_cachedDimensions`. It uses `chunkDimensions` (16x16x16) and asks `schematicWrapper` for an iterator.

// If `iterator.total_chunks()` is 0, then `schematicWrapper` thinks it's empty.
// This implies `set_block` failed or didn't expand the bounds.

// Is there a `resize` or `setSize` I missed?
// `SchematicWrapper` has `from_data(Uint8Array)`.
// Maybe I need to construct a dummy schematic file in memory (Sponge format or Litematic) with the desired size and load it?
// That seems like overkill but guaranteed to work.
